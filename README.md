# OSRS-ping

A tool to check ping on OSRS servers and to choose the best server for you.

# Running the tool

Requires Python 3.
To run it change your working directory to the folder with Main.py in the Command Line or PowerShell and then type this:
```
python main.py
```
It will take some time to check all 230 servers.


# TO-DO
* Currently working on being able to choose from which region the servers will be checked for example: only European serves.
* Next thing will be making it faster by checking multitple servers at the same time.
